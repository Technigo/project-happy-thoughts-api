# Happy Thoughts

Objective of this project is to apply useEffect to different state of the variable and experimenting fetching data and posting it to the same API.

## The problem
Challenges of this project is to undertand how useEffect work and to apply the "waterfall" methodology as well as to figure out how the univeral state and the local state work.

I succeeded in moving components/function/state according to the "Waterfall" methodology. Still, I decided to keep some stats inside the compoment for better performance.
