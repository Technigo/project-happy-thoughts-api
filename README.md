# Project Happy Thoughts API

The assignment was to create an API that includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data. This would then be linked up to the previous Happy Thoughts frontend project. 

## The problem

I referenced the class coding session as well as the assignments from the previous two weeks. Some alterations had to be made in the frontend part in order to properly process the response from the new API.
