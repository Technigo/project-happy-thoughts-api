# Project Happy Thoughts API

In this project I've built my very own API to a front end project I did earlier.

## The problem

I have build an API with some endpoints that matches another project I've build earlier this year. I have built it with Express and Mongodb. I have used GET request endpoints to return data (which renturn 20 results ordered by createdAt in decending order) and POST endpoints to create data. I have also included error handling to return good validation errors. I've also used Postman a lot to test my database.
