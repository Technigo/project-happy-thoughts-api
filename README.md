# Project Happy Thoughts API
This project was made during the Technigo bootcamp. The goal was to use Express and MongoDB to build an API that will serve as the backend to the previous project "Happy thoughts", where you can send Twitter-like messages that are saved to a database. The API should therefore include endpoints for GET requests to return the data (i.e. messages), and to POST so you can send messages and press "like" on messages.

This API also contains endpoints to delete and edit/patch a message, but those features aren't yet added to the frontend. The endpoint to get all messages sorts them from newest to oldest, and only shows 20 messages.
