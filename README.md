# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week I have build my own API for the Happy Thoughts Project from week 11 and created endpoints to post and update data using MongoDb for database storage and Mongoose.

## The problem

Next thing to change is that the frontend time stamp doesnt work correctly. I get it working in the backend though.
