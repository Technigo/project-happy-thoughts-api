# Project Happy Thoughts API

made my own api for the happy thoughts site we built in week 7

## The problem
Started working in the [template](https://github.com/kathinka/express-api-starter), and copied my work over into this repo.

Started building the API as I have done on the last tasks
wanted to add more to is as well, som made endpoint for it, but did not complete it as I rather wanted to join my team on working on the final task. So I revisit this later when I have more time!
