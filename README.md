# Project Happy Thoughts API

The assignment this week was to create my own database and endpoints for a previous Frontend project called Happy Thoughts.

## The problem

I have used Node.js, MongoDB and Heroku. I started with looking up what endpoints I needed and what information was in the original data for Happy Thoughts. If I had more time I would have added more features in the Frontend using, delete and patch from the backend.
