# Project Happy Thoughts API

The main goal of this project is to learn <bold> POST request: </bold> expose endpoints to my users to allow them to POST data to my API and then use that data to save new objects in my Mongo database.

## The problem

I'm working with <bold>mongoose</bold> in order to create the endpoints and manipulate the data. I started the project by creating a model for a simple 'Thought'.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
