# Project Happy Thoughts API

Building the backend and database for a previous frontend project completed the circle of creating a complete fullstack (MERN) project. The project itself is a social media clone where users can post thoughts that make them happy and those posts can then be liked.

## The problem

Using the knowledge from previous lectures and projects, I started by looking through this week's material and then setting up the project. When the foundations were done it kept going from there until a functioning back-end was the result. The front-end code was copied from my original Happy Thoughts project with minimal changes.

Tech: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS
