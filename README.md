# Project Happy Thoughts API

So this week we are creating our own API to our previous project Happy Thought.

## The problem

We had strict endpoint on our requirement-list for this project:
GET/thoughts
POST/thoughts
POST/thoughts/:thoughtsId/like

I found this project going quite smoothly. Now it's just connecting tge frondend from the previous project left.
