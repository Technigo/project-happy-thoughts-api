# Project Happy Thoughts API

This was a project I did while attending Technigo frontend bootcamp. The assignment was to use Express and Mongodb to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.

## The problem

The techniques I used was Express - Node.js and Mongodb. Besides that I used the recorded codealongs provided by Technigo, StackOverflow och the Mongoose documentation.
