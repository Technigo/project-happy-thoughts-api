# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week I created my on API for a twitter-like website called Happy Thoughts. I'm using MondgoDB to store the data that the user can insert.

## The problem

First I created a to do list to follow based on the instructions. Then I implemented the different routes when I had time to work. When all the endpoints where created I deployed with Render by modifiyng the connectiong string I created with Atlas in the last project.
