# Express API Project

This project is made by me on my 19th week of Technigo Boot Camp. 
It was my first experience with Full Stack Development. Connecting my own Backend development to an existing Frontend project  

## Documentation

    # Show all data - 
    https://happy-thoughts-dummy-api.herokuapp.com/thoughts

    # GET & POST on - '/thoughts'
    
    # POST on - '/thoughts/:id/like'

## The problem

Since this assignment was a first in a lot of ways it was just a challenge to recall the previous knowledge.
But eventually I was able to get it up and running
