# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week I learnt how to use POST request and sent it to the API, store the data and validate data. 


## The problem
I have trouble to keep up with all the info and how to use it in the best way. Luckily my team members are the best and help me through the questions I have. I had a struggle to get last week and this week deployed. But got some awesome help from Ida, a big shout out to you <3!

If I had more time I would read up more on backend in generall and how to connect it to the frontend.
