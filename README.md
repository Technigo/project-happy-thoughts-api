# Project Happy Thoughts API

The assignment was to building your own API to replace the existing one used in the Happy Thoughts React project. The new API should have the functionality of the original, including routes for fetching, adding, and liking thoughts, while ensuring input validation and error handling.

## The problem

I managed errors, validated input, connected to MongoDB, documented endpoints, set up Express routes, used environment variables and added basic logging.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
