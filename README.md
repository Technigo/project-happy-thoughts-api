# Project Happy Thoughts API

This weeks project was made by me at week 19 of Technigo bootcamp. 
We were supposed to make two make a GET-path/ and a POST-path to connect a frontend job we did.

With the GET-path we were supposed to fetch the API that we made, and the POST path to be able to post a message on the frontend. 
And also to to connect our like function to the message id. 

## The problem

My biggest problem with the project was with getting the Mongoose compass and database to function with my post path. But after renaming it, it worked. 
The next problem I had was with increments of likes in a message. I solved it by using a "if" statement and a easier code.
