# Project Happy Thoughts API

So this week we are creating our own API to our previous project Happy Thought.

## The problem

We had strict endpoint on our requirement-list for this project:
GET/thoughts
POST/thoughts
POST/thoughts/:thoughtsId/like

I found this project going quite smoothly. Now it's just connecting tge frondend from the previous project left.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
