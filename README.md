# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week we are building a backend to an existing frontend we built a few weeks ago. The first complete Fullstack Project.

## The problem

The first thing was building the schema. It was important to add enough properties for proper validation. After that I built the different endpoints with different error handlings. Then came deployment and adding thoughts with the POST method to the remote database on MongoDB Atlas. In the end I connected it to my excisting Frontend. Find both links below.
