# Project Happy Thoughts API

For this project I built my own API for a frontend project we did a couple of weeks ago. You can view the frontend for this API here: https://happy-thoughts-jennylarsen.netlify.app/
The project consists of RESTful endpoints, with specific instructions on how they should look and how the modeling of the API should look, that you can view here: https://github.com/Technigo/project-happy-thoughts-api/blob/master/instructions.md
The project has error handeling consisting of 200, 400 and 500 response messages. 

## The problem

To solve this project I started of building the model based on the learning material from this week, then I added the endpoints. Deployed the API and then applied it to the frontend. The project was easy to solve with clear instructions and tutorials.
