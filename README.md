# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project is about working with GET and POST calls towards API and MongoDB.

## The problem

To create this API I had to work with NodeJs, express, Mongoose and MongoDb. I learned how to create API endpoints, how to create models and how to fetch and create data to MongoDB using Mongoose. Also I used MongoDb Compass. When I got stucked with ideas or soultions I used Google and StackOverflow. While setting the live project I learned to work with mongo cloud and Heroku.
