# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week's project was to use our new skills with Express and Mongodb to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data. This API should replace the one we used in Happy Thoughts project in week 11. 

## The problem

This weeks project made me understand the Database and API's so much better! 
Looking forward to next week!!
