# Project Happy Thoughts API

This Express-MongoDB API project is an API built with Express and MongoDB, offering GET request endpoints for data retrieval and POST endpoints for data creation. It implements documented routes, ensures validation and error handling for user input, and handles errors when adding hearts to a thought.

## The problem

I based the code on a code along example and live session from Technigo but modified it. If I had more time I would fix the update of hearts to update without having to refresh the page. Tools: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, MongoDB Compass, MongoDB Atlas, Google Cloud.
