# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project aimed to apply recently acquired skills in Express.js and MongoDB to construct an API featuring GET request endpoints for data retrieval and POST endpoints for data creation.

## The problem

In this project, I utilized Express and Mongoose to construct an API, defining routes for both GET and POST methods. The API includes endpoints for displaying all messages and allowing users to add messages to the database. MongoDB Atlas is used for database storage, and Render is employed for API deployment. The project focuses on building a Mongoose model for thoughts (posts) with properties such as the message string, a heart property to track likes, and a createdAt property. Three endpoints are created to retrieve all thoughts, post a new thought, and update the number of likes for a post. The overarching goal is to develop a robust and scalable API with specific validations for message, hearts, and createdAt properties in the Thought model.
