# Project Happy Thoughts API

The goal of this project was to practice using POST requests and storing and updating data in a database.
This was a pair-programming project between Erika Andersson Porath and Katharina Liebig.

## The problem

We started writing each endpoint and testing it by using Postman. Then we added the username functionallity which required changes in both the backend and the frontend. After getting that to work we inplimented infinite scrolling by using a react package. We ran into some problems because of the poor documentation. We eventually managed to solve those by troubleshooting every step and component on it's own.
