# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project we built the API to a project we already built the front end to. Now we builit the backend and replaced the previous API with our own.

## The problem

There were no real problems this week. However getting the correct status codes and considereing what to send back to the frontend required a bit of a thought process. Although it was a nice expereince since being focused on forntend you really get annoyd when you don't get proper error messages from the backend.
