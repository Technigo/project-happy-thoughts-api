# Happy Thoughts API

## About

Welcome to the backend of Happy Thoughts! This is a custom-built API designed to serve as a backend for my Happy Thoughts React frontend application I did at Technigo bootcamp 2023. It aims to be a drop-in replacement for the Technigo API. The API is built using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and it features endpoints for creating, reading, and liking "happy thoughts".
