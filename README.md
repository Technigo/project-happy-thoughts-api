# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week's assignment was to create an API for an excisting frontend. 

## The problem

I started by creatiing the model while looking at the frontend to see what answers the app expected. At the end I added some extra features like filtering the messages by number of likes. I also took the opportunity to rebuild my frontend a bit, I experimented with the useEffect hook to get the allMessages component to rerender when I send in a new post.
