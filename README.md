# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week I've build my own API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data, using Express and MongoDB as a weekly project for Technigo bootcamp.

## The problem

I wasn't sure how to send an error message when the id of a happy thought that has been liked doesn't match an existing id. This was solved by using `try {} catch (err) {}`.
