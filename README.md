# Project Happy Thoughts API
Build a full API that is working well with an excisisting frontend, including handling user input (PATCH, POST, GET) and store the data from POST req in Mondodb. 
Add requirements to validate data and ensure your database only contains 'good' data.

## The problem

Built the API using POSTMAN, Express, node js and mongodDb deplying it to google cloude. When I had checked that everything worked fine after the deployment, I added the URL to my Happy thought project from week 7. You can find that project here:
