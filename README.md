# Project Happy Thoughts API

A project for practicing an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data. The API was built to be used by a happy thought twitter built using React (https://github.com/elsareutersward/project-happy-thoughts).

## The problem

To build the API I used Express and MongoDB. During the project I learnt how to model data in Mongoose, how to fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose and how to seed large amounts of data to a database. I also learnt to build a full API which includes handling of user input and includes error handling to return good validation errors. I also practiced creating an API that would work well with an existing frontend.
