# Project Happy Thoughts API
The task is to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data 
and POST endpoints to create data. Use this API and connect it to an earlier project, Happy Thoughts.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
