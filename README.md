# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project uses Express and MongoDB to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data. A little new for me was working more with validation for the data. 

## The problem

I had a very smooth running week. This project felt very straight forward, with the model, and simple routes, and no seeding to the database, since that will build itself during use. Even the deploy was an ease. It was fun to be able to go back and update an old project with some backend!
