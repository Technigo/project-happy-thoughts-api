# Project Happy Thoughts API

During this week, the task was to create our own API and end points, so we can later replace them into our previous Twitter-like project.

## The problem

I needed to be aware that any change we made to our backend it will be shown in the frontend of our project. Keeping that on mind, I created the API and endpoints using Mongoose and MongoDB.
If I have had more time, I would like to implement infinite scrolling when reaching the bottom of the page.
