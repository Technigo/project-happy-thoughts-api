# Project Happy Thoughts API

Building a RESTful API for the already existing Happy Thoughts project in week 15. Creating my own API and replace it with the other one. It should be possible to post and like thoughts.
It shows the last 20 thoughts and you can only post a thought between 5 and 140 characters.

## The problem

Trying to follow the code along as much as possible and remember what we did in week 14.
Had also trouble to make the API stable.
