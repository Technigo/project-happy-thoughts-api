# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project is an API for a 'Happy Thoughts' application, for which the frontend was built in an earlier project.

## The problem

The main challenge was setting up a MongoDB database and connecting it to the Express server correctly. I used Mongoose to define a schema and model for the thoughts, and created endpoints for getting all thoughts, posting a new thought, and most importantly -> liking the thoughts!

## View it live

The live project can be viewed here (please try to ignore the horrible styling):
