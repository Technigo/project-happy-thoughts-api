# Project Happy Thoughts API

In this project, I developed a backend API for "Happy Thoughts", a social media platform centered on sharing positive and encouraging messages. The goal was to replicate the functionality of an existing API used in a React frontend, allowing users to post thoughts, view a list of recent thoughts, and 'like' their favorites.

## The problem

I used Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create the API. I planned the project by first designing the data model and then implementing the routes needed for the frontend. If I had more time, I would add features like thought categorization and user authentication.
