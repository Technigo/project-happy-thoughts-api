# Project Happy Thoughts API
The brief is to create our own API and connect it to the frontend in the project https://github.com/carolinebirgersson/project-happy-thoughts

## The problem

The mission this week was to use our new skills with Express and Mongodb to build an API that includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data. 
I learned:
- How to build a full API which includes handling of user input
- How to include error handling to return good validation errors
- How to build an API which works well with an existing frontend
