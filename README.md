# Project Happy Thoughts API

Happy Thoughts API for message, liked and created time.

## The problem

Since last week we have learned mongo DB. This week is easier. During the procedure I have got some small problems such as syntax error. 

From this project, I understand more about the previous project -- Happy Thoughts. Because when I was working on this project (frontend side), I didn't really understand that how to increate the heart's number by posting thoughts id. Actually untill today, I was still confused. But now when I tested the post require by postman, I got the point.
