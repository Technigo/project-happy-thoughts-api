# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project was the to create a backend api, to connect to a frontend we previously created. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, connected to a MongoDB Atlas database, and the frontend is deployed on Netlify. The project also includes the use of .env files.

## The problem

- .env
- Atlas
- Postman

Figuring out CORS was a bit challenging. After adding my Netlify URL to the allowed origins, my deployed version started working as intended.
