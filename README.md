# Project Happy Thoughts API

frontend: https://happy-twitterish.netlify.com/
backend: https://happy-twitterish-api.herokuapp.com/thoughts

Building my own API to the Happy Thought Project I built last year.

Experimenting with backend, trying to get a hang of MongoDB, Mongoose, Postman, Mongo DB Compass and Heroku. Still trying to figure out how to use all the tools to be more efficient.
