# Project 19 - Happy Thoughts API

Week 19 @ Technigo Bootcamp was to use our new skills with Express and Mongodb to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data. We we're supposed to build the backend for a frontend project we did earlier in the bootcamp.

API: https://nyblad-happy-thoughts.herokuapp.com/  <br>

Frontend to try it out: https://nyblad-happy-thoughts.netlify.com/ <br>

* How to build a full API which includes handling of user input <br>
* How to include error handling to return good validation errors <br>
* How to build an API which works well with an existing frontend <br>

## Technologies used
