# Project Happy Thoughts API

The project was about using my new skills with Express and MongoDB to build an API which includes both Get request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data


## The problem

I started off with the endpoint displaying a list of 20 happy thoughts. After that I created the POST request. I made sure it worked to post to the API before connecting the API to my frontend. 
When everything was set up and working I built the endpoint for posting likes. 

## Learning objectives

- Build a full API which includes handling of user input
- Including error handling to return good validation errors
- Build an API that works well with an existing frontend

## Tech

- Node.js
