# Project Happy Thoughts API

I built an API which includes a Thought Mongoose model which has properties for the message string, a heart property for tracking the number of likes, and a createdAt property to store when the thought was added. This API is used in this front-end project: https://hang-nguyen-happy-thoughts-project.netlify.app

## The problem

I added three endpoints for returning all the thoughts, posting a new thought and updating the number of likes for a post. I also tried out pagination, which means that the user can put in queries on page number and limit of the number of thoughts per page, and get only the thoughts on that page returned to them.
