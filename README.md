# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project was about creating an API that lets the user not only fetch data but also add new data to the database and update existing one.

## The problem

Things that were new to me was to use POST requests for adding and updating data. I used Postman while testing my API. I worked with Node, Express, MongoDB and Heroku.
