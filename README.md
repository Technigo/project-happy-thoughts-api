# Project Happy Thoughts API

The project is about building an Express app that can serve as a backend to an already existing frontend app - Happy Thoughts, kind of a twitter. The backend can provide the frontend with a list of thoughts (GET), create a new thoght (POST), add a heart to a thought (POST), and delete a thought (DELETE). 

I started by setting up a Mongodb locally and set up a mongoose schema for the data.
