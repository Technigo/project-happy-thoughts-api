# Project Happy Thoughts API

Build our own API with MongoDB, moongoose and Express for a previous project - happy thought.

## The problem

It was a bit confusing when I tried to set up different files and folders for routes, controller, model and config from the beginning. I think I will do it differently next time when I am not familiar with the code yet. It is quite easily to get lost.
The deployment wasn't that smooth as well, I got an error "MongooseError: The `uri` parameter to `openUri()` must be a string, got “undefined”", which is not very specific of what the root problem really is. But I tried to search on Slackover flow and explore possible issue with chat GPT and I solved it.
