# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project was the to create a backend api, to connect to a frontend we previously created. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, connected to a MongoDB Atlas database, and the frontend is deployed on Netlify. The project also includes the use of .env files.

## The problem

The challenges were creating the Atlas database and setting it up correctly due to some errors, however, I am getting used to Postman and Compass, and these tools helped me test my way to fix the issues.

The biggest challenge was figuring out CORS as this was new to me. Previously it has just been there as an initated middleware I did not have to do anything with. After adding my Netlify URL to the allowed origins, my deployed version started working as intended, but this was not intuitive for me at this point.
