# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week's project uses my new skills with Express and MongoDB to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.

This new API was then added to my Week 7 Happy Thoughts project (practicing my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API in a "twitter" like app).

## The problem

<ins>Describe how you approached to problem</ins>: After the many errors I encounted last week, this week was straightforward and I was happy to complete this project with little issues. I followed along closely with this week's videos and compelted some codealongs. Stack overflow was helpful as was our Slack community, giving simple instructions on how to connect my old Week 7 project to my new API.
The mongoose syntax is still new to me and I need more time to understand it, but so far so good!

<ins>How did you plan?</ins>: Gonig through all this weeks learning material was vital to help me set up the POST requests correctly.

<ins>What technologies did you use?</ins>: Express API, MongoDB, Mongoose, Postman, MongoDB Atlas

<ins>If you had more time, what would be next?</ins>: I would populate the database with more entries and perfect the error handling and validation.
