# Project Happy Thoughts API
### Week 15 Technigo Bootcamp
For week 15 we built our own API for the happy thoughts project that we had in the earlier weeks of the bootcamp then we used that deployed API for our previously built happy thoughts frontend page. 

## The problem
I started by writing the server.js similar to last week only this week we discussed post/get/patch and delete. I checked the output using postman, mongodb compass and then deployed to google cloud platform using the same connection thru mongoAtlas that I created last week. 

If I had more time I would implement the delete function for each note and refresh the design of the frontend.
