# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week we created a backend for our previous frontend project: https://dynamic-puffpuff-f7c490.netlify.app/
## The problem

The problem was to make our own backend with routes for the previous frontend project "Happy Thoughts"
We did diffrent routes depending on what the "user" does,
IF the wanted to add a thought,
or like a posted thought
Tech used
MongoDB -> moongose -> Google cloud -> React -> API - Javascript

If I had more time:
I would add more routes that sortet 
example: sort by most liked
