# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week the task was to create the API ourselves for an already existing React project, Happy Thoughts. Previously the app used an existing API but this week it was time to replace it with our own. The project utilises Express.js and MongoDB.

## The problem

After last week's project now being a bit more familiar with Mongo, I found building this one quite fun. It was great to see a frontend and a backend I've built working together!

The videos from this week were really helpful with this project.
