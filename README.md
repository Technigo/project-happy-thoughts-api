# Project Happy Thoughts API
## 🏁 Goals:
Create my own API.
Expose endpoints to your users to allow them to POST data to your API and then use that data to save new objects in Mongo database.

**Must-have requirements**:<br>
✅ API should implement the routes exactly as documented.<br>
✅ `GET /thoughts` endpoint should only return 20 results, ordered by `createdAt` in descending order.<br>
✅ API should validate user input and return appropriate errors if the input is invalid.<br>
✅ In the `POST /thoughts` endpoint to create a new thought, if the input was invalid and the API is returning errors, it should set the response status to `400` (bad request).<br>
✅ The endpoint to add hearts to a thought should return an appropriate error if the thought was not found.
