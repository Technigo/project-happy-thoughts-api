# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week's project is to use Express and MongoDB to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.

## The problem

It was tricky to understand how the infrastructure was going to work. One thing that helped my to better understand how to connect the api and database with the old front end project was to create a workspace in vs code. The deploy process was difficult.
