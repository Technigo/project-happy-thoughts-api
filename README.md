# Project Happy Thoughts API
This is a backend project using Mongo DB and Express to store data and set up endpoints to allow users to POST data to the API and then use that data to save new objects in the Mongo database.

This newly created API was then tested out in the old project Happy Thoughts from week 7 of the boot camp, to learn how to link frontend together with our own API.

Routes:

/thoughts (Send a GET request to show all posted happy thoughts or send a POST request to post a happy thought.)
/thoughts/:thoughtId/like (Add a heart/like to a message.)

## The problem
- How to use POST requests to send data to your API
- How to store data in your database from POST requests
- How to validate data and ensure your database only contains 'good' data
- How to build a full API which includes handling of user input
- How to build an API which works well with an existing frontend
