# Project Happy Thoughts API

This weeks assignment was to create an API backend to add to the previous Happy Thoughts project.
## The problem

The code was pretty straight forward. My issue was more with the connection to Atlas. I created a cluster for last weeks project and tried hard and long to add this weeks collection. The data was sent but there was some form of issue with the connection to Atlas. I ended up getting help which didn't solve the issue. In the end I had to create a new account and then magically everything worked.
