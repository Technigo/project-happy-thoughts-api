# Project Happy Thoughts API

This weeks project was to create an API for showing and storing messages sent by my previous Happy thoughts site.

In this project I'm using express and mongoose to create the model of the API and to create the different routes. There is one route which uses the GET method to show all the messages in the API, and route which uses the POST method to allow the user to add messages to the database.

I've used MongoDB Atlas to store the database and Render to deploy the API.

## The problem

This weeks project has been a smooth process with very few issues. To have an overview of my API and the database I used Postman. In the code I've added error handler so that it's also shown in Postman if the GET or POST request fail.
