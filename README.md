# Project Happy Thoughts API

The assignment was to build an API for a "Happy Thoughts" application for which we have already built the frontend, where users can post happy thoughts and like other users' thoughts. The API needed to provide endpoints for retrieving, posting, and liking thoughts.

## The problem

I approached the project problem by first defining the requirements and endpoints for the API. Then implemented the API using Express.js for handling HTTP requests, Mongoose for interacting with MongoDB to save posts in database, and Node.js for the server-side logic. I ensured that the API endpoints were properly implemented and tested using Postman.

Endpoints:

- https://alma-happy-thoughts-api.onrender.com/thoughts, GET request for list of 20 thoughts, POST request to send a new thought
- Backend: https://alma-happy-thoughts-api.onrender.com/thoughts/:thoughtId/like - POST request to like a thought
