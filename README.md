# Project Happy Thoughts API

To Build our own API, with Express and MongoDB, which includes GET/POST and PATCH request endpoints to return data and to create/edit data.

Using Happy thoughts project as a frontend to connect to bilt backend.
In the Happy Thoughts project week 7 we built a frontend in React which uses an API to store thoughts in chatboard.
Routes:
/thougths - use either GET or POST to see a list of thoughts or post a new one.
/thoughts/:thoughtId/like - increases the number of hearts/likes on a post.
The GET request should only return the latest 20 results.
## The problem

I have started from the lessons, one part was to re open the "old" Happy-thoughts-project and updat myself on the project to be able to use it as frontend. which endpoints do I have to use etc. 
I used PATCH request to find by Id and update the harts/likes for that thought.
We are to validate the data and ensure that the database contains "good" data.
To deploy the database and make the connection to frontend project.
