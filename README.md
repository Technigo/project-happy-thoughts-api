# Project Happy Thoughts API

I built an API to an earlier frontend-project: https://matilda-arvidsson-project-happy-thoughts.netlify.com/

## The problem

In this API I used MongoDB and Mongoose to make a model. The model contains of message, hearts, name (optional) and timestamp.

The API then have three routes, one get (for fetching all happy thoughts), and two post (one for posting a happy thought, and one for liking a happy thought).

If I had more time I would've added some filtering and sorting options to the get-endpoint. Now I just chose to sort by newest first.
