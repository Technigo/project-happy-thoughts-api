# Project Happy Thoughts API

In this week's project it was time to use my new skills with Express and MongoDB to build my own HAPPY THOUGHTS API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.

## What I have learnt

* How to use POST requests to send data to my API
* How to update data in my database from POST requests
* How to validate data and ensure my database only contains 'good' data

## The process and structure

I decided to keep it simple and stay at **BLUE LEVEL** ðŸ”µ with one feature from black level.

Added filtering and sorting options in  backend and frontend:

* Newest
* Oldest (default)
* Most likes

Avaialble endpoints:

* Root: /
* List 20 Thoughts: GET /thoughts
* Post a thought message: POST /thoughts
* Like a thought: POST /thoughts/:thoughtId/like

### Core Tech

* Javascript
* Express
* Mongo DB
* Moongoose
* Heroku
* Postman
* MongoDB Compass
