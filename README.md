# Project Happy Thoughts API

This API was created using Express JS, MongoDB and Mongoose. The API has three endpoints. One POST-method for sharing a thought. A GET-request for all thoughts saved in the database, with the 20 latest thoughts to be displayed. By sending a POST-request to the API endpoint "/like" you can also like a thought.

## The problem

I had problems with connecting my original frontend for Happy Thoughts so I decided to copy and paste it into this repository instead.
