# Project Happy Thoughts API 

Built my own backend to use on a pre-existing Happy thoughts :heart: project fronted. 

## :brain: Learning objectives
- how to build a full API which includes handling of user input
- how to include error handling to return good validation errors
- how to build an API which works well with an existing frontend

## :heavy_check_mark: Features
- GET /thoughts endpoint returning 20 resulta in descending order based on createdAt
- validated input (min and max length of message)
- custom error message
- returning an appropriate error in case of invalid input
- POST /thoughts endpoint to create a new thought

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Future improvements
- users can enter their username or remain anonymous
- implement pagination on backend and frontend to be able to click through pages of thoughts

## :robot: Tech used 
- JavaScript
- mongoose
- Postman
