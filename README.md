# Week 19: Project Happy Thoughts API

This week's project was to use Express and MongoDB to build an API with both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.

## The problem

This third project with backend was very simple for me, I had no issue/difficulty. The only thing I really had to find how was the right function in Mongoose to update the "hearts" property of an object in the database, nothing that a little googling didn't solve.

After building the API, I updated week 11's project to include the new API url. I also changed a little bit the frontend to add the input field to enter a name, and display this name beside each thought.
