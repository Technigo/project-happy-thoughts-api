# Project Happy Thoughts API

Project was to re-create the API that was previously provided for the frontend part of the happy thoughts project.

Unfortunately I had very little time to work on this project, hence I only managed to do the basic level requirements.

## The problem

This project continued of the learning path for backend, this time introducing POST as part of the endpoints, for being able to put things in the database instead of just reading as in the previous backend projects.

## View it live

Deployed on Heroku: https://project-happythoughts-api-olof.herokuapp.com
