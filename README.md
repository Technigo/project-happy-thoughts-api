# Project Happy Thoughts API

This backend project was about creating the possibility to post data into the API, with POST method, both a commment and to update/add liked to the comments. Also to create relevant endpoints. The last step would be to add this API to an old frontend project with the same theme, to see that it would work.

## The problem

I thought that the adding of a like to a specific id was the tricky part, and I spent some time with that. I also struggled with the deployment, I got stuck with an empty array, and it turned out I hadnt created the user properly in Atlas and therefore nothing worked, but I didnt get any error messages. I redid the database process to start fresh.
