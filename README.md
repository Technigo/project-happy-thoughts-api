# Project Happy Thoughts API

API to support the Happy Thoughts Project. Serve get requests and handle post request by querying a mongo database.

## The problem

I set up a connection to a database, MongoDB, and added endpoints needed to support the Happy Thoughts frontend using Express. Changed url in frontend to point to new server.

Further on I would like to try out and add more features like pagination and allowing the user to either be anonymous or to enter their name when they post their happy thought.
