# Project Happy Thoughts API

A few weeks ago we had a 'Happy Thoughts' React assignment, where we created our own version of Twitter, but focusing on positivity and friendliness. For that project we built the frontend and used an already existing API from Technigo to store the thoughts. For this project, wen built our own API which should work in the same way and should become a drop-in replacement for the API we used originally.

## The problem

I went through the material for the week thoroughly and practiced and coded along with the live code sessions, looked at how the original API was structured and how I needed to write my own endpoints and my mongoose model. I also studied previous week's projects and other people's code to understand what I needed to do. Practiced using Postman a lot more than I have been before, feeling more familiar with it now. Also felt more secure with how to use and understand Mongo DB Compass/ Atlas and how to deploy on Google Cloud.

I had some issues with getting my frontend to update correctly when I changed to this API, I had to refresh the page to be able to see a thought message that I had try to post and when I tried to like a message I had to refresh the page as well. With some stackOverflow discussions and some knowledge from the Thursday code session it turned out that I needed to update my fetch request to set the data correctly because how it was structured. Happy to have been able to find, understand and fix the issue!
