# Project Happy Thoughts API

This is a Happy Thoughts app which is like a positive version of Twitter. In this project I used Express and MongoDB to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data as well as POST endpoints to create data.
In the front end the user can post a happy thought which will be listed on the page and shows the count of 'likes' on each thought. User can then like any message and the the number of likes increases by 1.
