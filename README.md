# Project Happy Thoughts API

The challenge was to create an API for a previously built twitter type messaging site.  

## The problem

Users are able to post a message and like old messages with a like button. The API is linked to MongoDB. 

## View it live

API: https://happy-thoughts-api-sn.herokuapp.com/

The live site built with React: https://happy-thoughts-sn.netlify.app/
