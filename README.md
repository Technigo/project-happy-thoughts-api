# Project Happy Thoughts API

In this project I have worked with Express and MongoDB to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data. This API is inserted in a previous project called Happy Thoughts, an X (formerly known as Twitter) like site where you can post your happy thoughts.

## The problem

I had problem when deploying the backend project so I got helt from my group friends.
