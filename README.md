# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project was part of Technigo Bootcamp. This weeks assignment was to create an API for a previous front end project, which was basically a friendly twitter application. The task was to recreate the API so that you only needed to change the URL in the front end and it should still work!

## The problem

I found this week a lot easier than last week, mainly because I had some time to understand what I was doing and also the lectures was very helpful and the problems I had last week with deploying the data base was not at all a problem this week :)

I created all the endpoints used in the front end, but also included some more to delete a post and modify a message in the backend.
