Project built during Technigo Bootcamp

# Project Happy Thoughts API

The project was to make a backend for our previous project Happy Thoughts with endpoints to GET all thoughts, POST a new thought and like/add heart to a post.

## The problem

For my project I used mongoose, Express and MongoDB.
To test the backend I used Postman and MongoDBCompass, and it's deployed on Heroku.

Endpoints:

GET '/thoughts'

Displays all happy thoughts in the backend.

---

POST '/thougths'

Lets you post a new message to the backend.

---

POST '/thoughts/:thoughtId/like'

Increases nr of likes/hearts.
