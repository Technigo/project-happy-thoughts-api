# Project Happy Thoughts API
This weeks project was made by me at week 19 of Technigo bootcamp. We were supposed to make two make a GET-path/ and a POST-path to connect a frontend job we did.

With the GET-path we were supposed to fetch the API that we made, and the POST path to be able to post a message on the frontend. And also to to connect our like function to the message id.
