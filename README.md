# Project Happy Thoughts API
This project was about building an API with Mongo to store data. The API is connected to a previous project "Happy Thoughts" where the users can post messages. So this API has a route which enables a user to post data where the data is also validated. 

## The problem
I started the project by setting up the get requests and deploying the API using Heroku and Mongo. Eventually I started with the post requests for hearts and messages and when that worked I aimed for connecting it with my frontend project. 

It worked very well in the local version but then I had some netlify-related problems with deploying the frontend part, which I will try to solve as soon as possible. 

If I had more time I would develop my fronend project a bit more so that I would implement all of the backend functionality, such as being able to edit thoughts. I would also like to display error messages fron the backend.

My project is deployed via Heroku:
