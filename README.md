# Project Happy Thoughts API üíå

- In this week's project we used our new skills in Express and Mongodb to build an API which includes POST-request endpoints to create data, and GET-request endpoints to return data. We revisited our "Happy Thoughts" project from a couple of weeks ago, were we built a frontend in React which uses an API to store happy thoughts (in the previous project we built a frontend application with a form to post happy thoughts, list the most recent thoughts, and show a count of "hearts/likes" on each thought. Users could then click a heart to like a thought). 

- For this project, the task was to take this application one step further and build the API ourselves. Our own API is supposed to work in the same way, and become a drop-in replacement for the API we used in the previous project.
