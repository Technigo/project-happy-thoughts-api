# Project Happy Thoughts API

For this project, I built my own API which works in the same way and should become a drop-in replacement for the API I used in the Happy Thoughts React frontend project.

## The problem

I created my own API with the Mongoose model for the thougth message and the endpoints to get, post tohughts and likes. After the MongoDB project I thought this project was easier, but I had problems with connecting the frontend and thats because I was missing one word from the deployment.
