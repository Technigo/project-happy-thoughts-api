# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week we were supposed to build an API with GET and POST endpoints to create data. This API were then going to be connected to the frontend part of Happy Thoughts, a Twitter like project that we did several weeks ago.

## The problem

I started off by coding the ThoughtModel and then went on to setting up the routes and server.js. It felt a bit easier this time to execute it since it was similar to other things we have done. I tried it out in Postman which was good practice since I haven't used it much before. I also added a loader, because especially from my phone, it could take a while to load all the posts.
I used the provided material to help me through the assignment, as well as discussing with my team mates, searching online and chatGPT.
