# Project Happy Thoughts API

As part of a Technigo Web Dev Bootcamp project, this API was created using Express JS, MongoDB and Mongoose. The API has three endpoints. One POST-method for sending in a thought either in a testing environment using Postman or utilizing a frontend application and input fields to add to the API. By sending a GET-request, all "thoughts" saved in the database will be displayed, in a descending order with the 20 first "thoughts". The user can also like "thoughts" by sending a POST-request to the API endpoint "/like". An additional endpoint for a uniqe "thought" has also been added. 

## Environment Variables
