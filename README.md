# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week I created an API that worked with a pre-existing project, the Happy Thoughts project. 

## The problem

Buildling this API required understanding more about how the original Happy Thoughts API worked and replicating. This ensured that my API worked smoothly with the existing frontend. I spent a while reviewing the materials for the week and completing the codealong. I also referred to the way I had written the previous week's project to reinforce how to use mongoose, MongoDB, Atlas, and Compass. Once this API was deployed, I replaced the original API in the Happy Thoughts project, and tested it to ensure it worked. 

If I had more time, I would implement pagination and potentially add additional features to the API/frontend.
