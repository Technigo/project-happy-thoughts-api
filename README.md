# Project Happy Thoughts API

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

The assignment was to build an API to go with my previous frontend project "Happy thoughts".

## The problem

Using a mongoose model, I created GET, POST and PATCH endpoints for the user to allow him/her to view, post and like messages.

## View it live

API: https://project-happy-thoughts-api-2su4jgkxaa-lz.a.run.app
Frontend: https://happy-thoughts-jessika.netlify.app/ (see code here: https://github.com/jessikalind/project-happy-thoughts)
