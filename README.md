# Project Happy Thoughts API

The brief was to create the back end of a previously made twitter-clone front end project.

## The problem

Using MongoDB and express I set up the API that would house the backend. It was a fairly straitforward process, making endpoints for GET requests and POST requests.

If/when I have more time I would flesh out the error handling a bit more. As of right now it's very basic.
