# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week's project was about creating the backend for the Happy Thoughts project we did earlier in the bootcamp. This time, I had to code the server of the API where data from the MongoDB database can be handled using GET and POST methods.

## The problem

The main challenge was understanding and implementing the necessary code to connect to a database within a short timeframe.
