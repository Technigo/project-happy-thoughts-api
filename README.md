# Project Happy Thoughts API

Create a back end to happy thought front en project.


## The problem

I started to create the model of what to get and push. Started with the get endpoint and then push to uppdate posts. 
When I was done with the endpoint and the test in postman worked I ceonnected the back end whit the front end and get the page to work.
