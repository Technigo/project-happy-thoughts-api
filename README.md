# Project Happy Thoughts API

The challenge here was to dreate an api that has functional endpoints for the project https://ninamansster-happy-thoughts.netlify.com/

## The problem

I approached this problem with learning from Technigo videos and checklists. I have read some documents from Mongoose also. Before i did my first merge to Github I hade several test-apis running. Before I deployed my final api to Heroku, the endpoints were tested at localhost.

Project brief: https://www.notion.so/Project-Happy-Thoughts-API-3dc1710667304987894f954dad265fc9

### Tech
I worked with a Mongo-database. The database was set up as a node express server with mongoose in VS COde. I tested the endpoints in Postman and checked items in Mongo Compass.

### Endpoints at https://happy-thoughts-ninamansster.herokuapp.com/
#### GET /
#### POST /
#### POST /:thoughtId/like

### Further steps
I would add a name-field and validation of that.
I would also do a check on not wanted words on a black-list, to keep it as happy, happy as possible.
Edit posted message would also be great.
