# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project was about building an API using Express, MongoDB with GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data. The project is also connected to a prior project. 

## The problem

This week, my understanding of the backend has become a bit clearer, although I still find it somewhat complicated. ChatGPT has been of great help in getting the project started.
