# Project Happy Thoughts API

For this project i created the API for happy thoughts  with mongo DB and connect it with the frontend. 

## The problem

For the happy Thoughts project i created the following features:

- User login: with options to create a new user (POS - https://happy-thoughts-api-mongodb-aut.herokuapp.com/signup) and validate existing users ( GET- https://happy-thoughts-api-mongodb-aut.herokuapp.com/signin ) 
- Get happy Thoughst to show the last 20 messages. (POS-https://happy-thoughts-api-mongodb-aut.herokuapp.com/)
- Post new messages,itÂ´s required username (POS- https://happy-thoughts-api-mongodb-aut.herokuapp.com/thoughst)
- Post Like to a message. ( POS - https://happy-thoughts-api-mongodb-aut.herokuapp.com/thoughts/id/like)
