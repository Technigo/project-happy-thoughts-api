# Project Happy Thoughts API

The assignment was to create a backend including a REST-API using Mongoose and MongoDB. The API is then used in my previous Happy Thought frontend-project.

## The problem

To solve the problem I used:
- MongoDB as data storage
- Mongoose to define the document structure in the database
- Mongo Cloud Atlas for database hosting
- Heroku for backend server hosting
- MongoDB Compass for testing
- Postman for testing

If I had more time I would experiment with more features that would require changes in the frontend to really understand how FE and BE is connected.
