# Project Happy Thoughts API

The Happy Thoughts API is a lightweight Express-based backend service designed for sharing and managing positive messages. With endpoints for posting, liking, and retrieving happy thoughts, it fosters a community-centered environment focused on spreading joy and positivity.

## The problem

The Happy Thoughts API encountered a snag with both posting thoughts and liking them due to a misconfiguration in the route definitions. By accurately specifying the endpoints under /thoughts/:thoughtId/like and /thoughts, respectively, I swiftly rectified the issue.
