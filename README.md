# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project is a backend API for the "Happy Thoughts" application, which allows users to post, view, like, and delete happy thoughts. The API is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## The Problem

The goal of this project is to create a robust and scalable API that supports various operations related to thoughts. The API defines a Thought model with specific validations for the message, hearts, and createdAt properties.

## Approach and Technologies Used

### Node.js
Used as the runtime environment for the server.

### Express
Chosen as the web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.

### MongoDB
Utilized as the database for storing thoughts.

### Mongoose
An ODM library for MongoDB, used to model thoughts and interact with the database.

### dotenv
Configured to handle environment variables, such as the MongoDB connection string.

### Express List Endpoints
Integrated to automatically generate API documentation.

The project follows RESTful conventions with endpoints for retrieving all thoughts, creating a new thought, retrieving a specific thought by ID, updating hearts on a thought, and deleting a thought.

## How I Approached the Problem

### Model Definition
Defined a Thought model with proper validations for the message, hearts, and createdAt properties.

### Express Routes
Implemented routes for CRUD operations on thoughts using Express.

### MongoDB Connection 
Established a connection to MongoDB, allowing the API to persistently store and retrieve thoughts.

### Error Handling
Implemented error handling for various scenarios, providing meaningful responses.

### Deployment
Deployed the API to MongoDB Atlas to make it accessible online.

## If I Had More Time
Given more time, I would consider the following enhancements:

### User Authentication 
Implement user authentication to allow users to have personalized experiences.

### Pagination
Add support for paginating through large sets of thoughts.

### Testing
Implement comprehensive testing for the API using tools like Mocha and Chai.

### Logging
Integrate logging to capture and analyze application events.

The API is live and can be accessed at [Project Happy Thoughts API](https://movie-app-406016.el.r.appspot.com).

- The endpoint "/" returns documentation of [Happy-Thoughts API Express List Endpoints](https://movie-app-406016.el.r.appspot.com/).
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements) is available at [Thoughts Collection](https://movie-app-406016.el.r.appspot.com/thoughts).
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element) is available at [Single Thought](https://movie-app-406016.el.r.appspot.com/thoughts/65678a2200447e5aa66c2b27).

Feel free to explore the various endpoints and interact with the API using your preferred API client or tools like Postman.
