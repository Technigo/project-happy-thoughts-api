# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week's project is to use new skills with Express and MongoDB to build an API which includes both:
* GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.

What you need to do:
✓ Your API should implement the routes exactly as documented in the instructions about the project.
✓ Your GET /thoughts endpoint should only return 20 results, ordered by createdAt in descending order.
✓ Your API should validate user input and return appropriate errors if the input is invalid.
✓ In the POST /thoughts endpoint to create a new thought, if the input was invalid and the API is returning errors, it should set the response status to 400 (bad request).
✓ The endpoint to add hearts to a thought should return an appropriate error if the thought was not found.

## The problem

I started out with watching the videos for the week and then watched the recorded versions of the live-sessions.
I had some issues with the deploy but fixed it with some guidance.
