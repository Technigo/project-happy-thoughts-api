# Project Happy Thoughts API

I used your new skills with Express and Mongodb to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.

- How to build a full API which includes handling of user input
- How to include error handling to return good validation errors
- How to build an API which works well with an existing frontend

## The tools

Mongoose
Mongo DB
Express
Javascript ES6

## The problem

Nothing was updated on my frontend page (I fixed it by asking i stack, I had not updated the new api in the whole app)
The likes wouldn't update in the backend (I fixed it when I looked at the code and my mongoos model didn't match my frontend code.
