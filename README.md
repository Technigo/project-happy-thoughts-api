# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week's project was to use Express and MongoDB to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data. It is now also connected to the week 7 project "Happy Thoughts".

## The problem

We got exact instructions on endpoints:
GET /thoughts - This endpoint should return a maximum of 20 thoughts, sorted by createdAt to show the most recent thoughts first.
POST /thoughts - This endpoint should be used to add a new post.
POST thoughts/:thoughtId/like -  Given a valid id in the URL, the API should find that post, and update its hearts property to add one heart.
