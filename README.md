# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week, I learnt about allowing user to POST data to my API and then use that data to save new objects in my Mongo database.

Some things I learnt within API:
methods: POST, GET, PATCH

Also use useful error message to help backend developer to understand what went wrong. And last but not least, to connect backend work with frontend work.

## The problem

I tackled the problem by looking at the code throughly. There was a bit of problem to connect the frontend & backend but it was not really a code problem but rather memory problem. Since the happy thought project was done some time ago, I forgot that API key & object are important to connect with the backend. However, everything was solved by being very meticulous with the process.
