# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week it was time to build my own API using Express.js, Mongoose and MongoDB, and then connect it with one of my previous front end projects - Happy Thoughts, which make this my first fullstack project.

## The problem

I started with models and created it in a new folder to keep the server.js more organized and modular. Then I created different endpoints to GET and POST the data.

If I had more time I would like to keep building to make it even better.
