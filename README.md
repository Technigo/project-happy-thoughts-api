# Project Happy Thoughts API
This project implements a RESTful API backend for managing "happy thoughts", allowing users to post thoughts, view recent thoughts, and like specific thoughts.

## The problem

The assignment was to create a backend API that supports the following features:

Create a new thought with a message that meets specific validation criteria.
Retrieve the 20 most recent thoughts sorted by creation date.
Increment the "hearts" count of a specific thought by ID.
## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
