# Project Happy Thoughts API

Developed a custom API using Node.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose and connected the API to my Happy Thoughts app, a React-based social media platform focused on sharing positive thoughts. 

API ensures validation for thought content and proper error handling.

## Endpoints
#### fetch thoughts 
(GET /thoughts)
#### posting new thoughts 
(POST /thoughts)
#### liking thoughts 
(PATCH thoughts/:thoughtId/like)

## The problem

Had some issues with deployment, but solved it with help of peers.
