# Project Happy Thoughts API

The project was to create our own api for our previously done frontend. Practising get, post and patch requests. 

## The problem

I first sketched up which endpoints I needed and then tried to follow code alongs and change the code to fit my project. When I got stuck I reached out to my awseome team. In this project I did a lot of minor misstakes that caused errors, but together with my teammates we solved them all and got to learn a lot!
