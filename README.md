# Project Happy Thoughts API

- I used try and catch in all endpoints for error handling.

## Endpoints

Displays the latest 20 thoughts, sorted by createdAt to show the most recent thoughts first.

POST /thoughts
Endpoint to post and save a new thought to the database. 

POST /thoughts/:thoughId/like

## TECH
