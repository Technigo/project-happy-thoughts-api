Project Happy Thoughts API
https://www.notion.so/Project-Happy-Thoughts-API-3dc1710667304987894f954dad265fc9


Then, you'll need to add 3 endpoints:
### `POST /thoughts`
This endpoint expects a JSON body with the thought `message`, like this: `{ "message": "Express is great!" }`. If the input is valid (more on that below), the thought should be saved, and the response should include the saved thought object, including its `_id`.

### `POST thoughts/:thoughtId/like`
This endpoint doesn't require a JSON body. Given a valid thought id in the URL, the API should find that thought, and update its `hearts` property to add one heart.

### Using your API
Once you've created your API, you should deploy it, and update your frontend project to use your own API instead of the old Technigo one. The idea is that if you build this API correctly, **the only thing you should need to change in the frontend code is the URL to the API,** to change it from the Technigo one to the one you deploy.
